# Naive Bayes Classifier in C++

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier in C++. The Naive Bayes algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification tasks. It leverages the probabilistic relationship between input features and target labels to make predictions.

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Implementation**: The project includes a complete implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm in C++. It incorporates the necessary calculations and data structures to train a model and perform classification based on the provided features.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The implementation provides functionality for preprocessing input data. It handles tasks such as feature scaling, handling missing values, and categorical feature encoding. These preprocessing steps ensure that the input data is properly prepared for training and classification.

- **Model Training and Prediction**: The implementation supports training the Naive Bayes model using labeled training data. It then utilizes the trained model to predict the class labels for new, unseen data instances. The classification process follows the probabilistic calculations and assumptions of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
