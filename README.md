# Naive Bayes Image Classification using Cinder Graphics Framework

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for image classification, specifically designed to classify 28 by 28-pixel images. The application utilizes the Cinder graphics framework to provide a visually interactive interface for training and testing image classification models.

## Features

- **Naive Bayes Classification**: The implementation includes the Naive Bayes algorithm, a popular probabilistic classifier widely used in machine learning. It leverages the assumption of independence between features to efficiently classify images based on their pixel values.

- **Image Dataset**: The application supports a dataset of 28 by 28-pixel images for training and testing the classification model. The dataset can be easily loaded and processed to extract the relevant features required by the Naive Bayes algorithm.

- **Visualization**: The application utilizes the Cinder graphics framework to provide a visually appealing interface for interactive training and testing of the image classification model. Users can visualize the training progress, examine the classification results, and gain insights into the model's performance.
